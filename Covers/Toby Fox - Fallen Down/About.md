### Toby Fox is an American composer and videogame developer, most known for his critically acclaimed indie venture, Undertale.

Despite its viral success after the game was released, *Fallen Down* was originally composed for an *Earthbound* fan project in which several artist used the original sounds from *Earthbound* to create new music. Funnily enough, *Megalovania*, the other massively recognized track from Undertale, was also used in a couple of projects before finding its place in *Undertale*.
