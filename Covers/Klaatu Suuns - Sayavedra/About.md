Klaatu Suuns is a dream pop/psych rock project from Mexico City, led by Carlo Pureco.

Sayavedra is the sixth track off of his debut album, named after the place he lived in during his teenage years.
The name Klaatu Suuns is a combination of two of Pureco's favorite bands, Klaatu and Suuns, which in itself is a practice borrowed from one of his other favorite bands, Pink Floyd.
This cover was done with the live version of Sayavedra in mind.
